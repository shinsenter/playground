# playground
My playground with code.

Update:

In June 2025, my family welcomed a new member.

During my parental leave, I had a bit of free time and decided to spend it working on a few small projects using new frameworks (partly to satisfy my curiosity, and partly to gain experience for future projects).

Feel free to check each branch with the `demo-` prefix for details.
